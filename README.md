# Soup's Pantry

A collection of my APIs.

## TODO

Next steps

- Test the validator decorators
- Move common descriptions of the api to a variable
- getting a better grip on decorators + <> vs as
- move db to service
- add some tests for habits - maybe take up TDD
- Secure the API

## Future Plans

- [ ] Create a CRON that checks the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/) daily and creates entries for cycling
